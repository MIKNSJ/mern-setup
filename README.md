# MERN Setup

This repository serves as a test enviroment to setup the M.E.R.N stack.

NOTE: This is not a template to write your code as you will need to set up the
working environment yourself. This is for viewing purposes only.

NOTE: M.E.R.N stands for [M]ongoDB, [E]xpressJS, [R]eact, and [N]ode.

NOTE: I will use PostgreSQL database instead of MongoDB. Please refer to older
branches where I use MongoDB.
